January and February are the coldest months in Winnipeg; and for Winnipeg’s homeless, these months
can be extremely rough to survive. In light of this fact, this past February HOPE Winnipeg volunteers brought
out their stockpots and rolled up their sleeves to make homemade soup and stews for the needy patrons of
Winnipeg’s Main Street Project emergency shelter.

Over 20 families cooked large batches of nutritious soup at home and brought them to HOPE to collect on
February 26th, 2012. Winnipeg volunteers excitedly gathered to donate and peruse the 80 one-litre
containers of various soups and stews collected. Two volunteers then filled their car with the various aromas
and delivered the containers to the happy recipients of Main Street Project.
