Several of the members of the team HOPE worldwide of Quebec had the chance to work as volunteers for HOPE in many countries.


h2. Port-au-Prince

After organizing a fund-raiser for the disaster victims of Port-au-Prince, Anne-Marie Racine participated in a help program of HOPE worldwide by offering post-traumatic psychological help to the residents after the earthquake. She was also able to visit and encourage the children of the orphanage of Cap-Haïtien. She shares: 'My experience in Haiti with HOPE worldwide was enriching. I was inspired by their strength and hope.'


André-Paul Vénor has worked in a medical clinic of HOPE worldwide at Port-au-Prince for almost 7 years. Although the main goal of the clinic was to offer basic health care to the persons living in the rough areas of Port-au-Prince, sick people form the neighbourhood were coming to get themselves treated. Since June 2011, Paul André was responsible for the programs of HOPE worldwide in Montreal.

Anne Du Sault has given up her vacation time to go and help several countries where HOPE worldwide was offering help programs (South Africa, Ivory Coast, India, Russia). She has been in charge of the Quebec chapter since January 2009. We see her here at the Petite-Bourgogne in Montreal giving school bags to children.
