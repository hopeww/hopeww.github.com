Earlier on this year, Bagnos Torres, a HOPE volunteer in Toronto, conducted a workshop on Personal Finances for 20 women living at the YWCA Shelter in Toronto.  The main purpose of the workshop was to help the women develop new skills in managing their personal finances and enhance their self esteem.

This lively workshop covered different topics, from establishing and managing personal credit, to applying for a credit card or a loan from a bank. Bagnos outlined and simplified the steps involved in buying a house and taught the women strategies to help them pay down debts. The workshop would not have been complete without facts on assets and liabilities, investment vehicles, different types of insurance and retirement planning.

One of the participants commented “The workshop was perfect and timely!”  The women were able to learn and develop financial skills and knowledge and also developed new, life changing relationships. It was an encouraging time of fun and fellowship with the HOPE volunteers.

For the HOPE volunteers, the workshop was an opportunity for them to imitate Christ by using their professional skills to serve and have a life changing impact on the community.  Even the YWCA was highly impressed, and requested more, similar workshops.  HOPE is making a real difference and changing lives in Toronto.
