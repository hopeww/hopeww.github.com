h2. Tell us about yourself (occupation, hobbies, future aspirations)

My name is Ian Liwanag. I'm an ex-electrician that has given up the trade (since 92) to pursue my passion in photography. Also a Dj of 26 years, I continue to be part of my client's most important date of their lives…. their wedding day. I'm blessed to be doing what I've been loving for so long that it makes a difference in my clients lives. I'm not just any "DJ" as my clients always tell me. "My website":http://www.ianliwanag.com

h2. Why did you decide to take part in the New Orleans Outreach Trip

I am part of the Toronto Church of Christ. My wife has been a christian for many years. Myself, I just got baptized three weeks ago and am stoked to be in the light of the Lord! Truly a feeling I can't explain, but am very happy! Everyone that knows of me, especially in the church, each and every disciple, has played a part in where I am today.

In the fall of 2010 I was told of the efforts of Neville Yee (also part of the Toronto Church of Christ), HOPE worldwide of Canada and plans once again to head south to New Orleans. As I sat with my wife and heard Neville speak we both looked at each other and said, "You want to go?" 
For all my life and how I've lived, I said it was time to give back to the community. I never really thought about things such as this. It was always me first. I can't remember anything in the past that I could say that "I contributed to society". I did back in high school, but it was for credit. At the time I thought nothing of it. I was even embarrassed to do my community hours with FOOD PATH.

But now as I write this and I do look back, YES, I'm humbled by the needy and who I served while at FOOD PATH. FOOD PATH is The City of Mississauga's largest foodbank. It was an open door service and depending on who dropped by food was distributed accordingly. I can remember clearly a family of five, Father, Mother and 3 small children. Dirty, nothing but the clothes on their back. It was something you'd see on TV. It was real. Even now, it haunts me to think "Are they ok?"

Again, know that I went on this trip with my wife Grace, our son Anthony (18 years old), my cousin Shancel Mohammed, Delaine 
and Neville Yee, Kassie & Nature Gibner, Kristin Stewart, Brett Livesey, Lindsay Jurado, and Cheryl Parker. I was not a Christian at the time. 

I was also interested in documenting our efforts to let people know exactly what still exists today and that still needs to be done in the years to come.

h2. What were some of the highlights of your experience in New Orleans?

To start, as I made a personal comment to the church about my experiences in New Orleans, the feeling you get "while on your way" to New Orleans, "in" New Orleans and when you leave, the feeling of accomplishment, knowing you have made a difference in someone's life is unimaginable! To feel this, is to actually head down to New Orleans and work (sweat, tools in hand). I can't tell you the feeling I still have. It's amazing!

Some of the highlights was THE FOOD! Crawfish, shrimp, catfish, White Pizza (Butter, Feta cheese, shrimp and crawfish!), Rib at "The Joint", Beignets at Cafe Du Monde, the rich history, the life, entertainment of and people of New Orleans. OH, I can't forget the Snow Balls - Shaved ice, flavoured liquor, and ice cream.

Driving to and from our temporary residence of Adullam Christian Fellowship (Special thanks to Pastor Randy Millet) to see the many homes demolished and still damaged. It has been 6 years since the disaster. It truly felt like we were in a ghost town and on our way into battle.

I was very pleased to meet the owner of the home that we were assigned to: Ms. Barbara Williams. She visited us everyday to say thank you for being there and to help her rebuild her home for her brother and mother.

We shared a room that could house 26 men (women and men had separate rooms) and 13 bunk beds! Great to meet people from different parts of the world and how they strive to do their best to give back and to make a difference.

We learned a trade! For some who have never held a hammer, nail gun, paint brush or the operation of a table saw. It was all hands on! These skills will last you a lifetime!

To know that the homeowner is trusting a complete stranger to enter their home to work and all they can give in return is a "thank you". What do you say to that? How would you feel if you were in their shoes? 

As Sister Judy of the St. Bernard project put it: "For every imperfection from the volunteers, it's a gift to the homeowner, a reminder, that a stranger cared enough to help"

h2. What’s a typical day like during your trip?

One day to soak up all New Orleans has to offer. Sights, sounds and food.

Next day 7am wake up/shower/breakfast. 8:15am leave dorm and head to job site. 9am start work. Breaks and lunch are obviously normal like any other job. 4pm clean-up. 5pm shower/rest/get ready for dinner. 10pm lights out.

Breakfast and Dinner were included in the accommodations.



h2. What did you enjoy most about your experience in New Orleans?

The fact that we made a difference in the community. We have touched someone's life in ways they never though

h2. What did this experience in New Orleans teach you?

To give back to the community and not expecting anything in return. Give back first. The rewards are greater than anything monetary.


h2. Any advice to offer those interested in going to New Orleans next year?

This is the best and most rewarding trip you will ever make. DO IT! You will never regret, but only look for a time again to make a difference in a person's life. It's life changing.

h2. Has this experience helped you view to service to the poor and needy differently from before? 

YES!!! They are people too. And just like us when we need a hand we may ask for assistance because we can. For others who don't have anyone, who do they turn to?


h2. Any final thoughts?

I hope to personally share your joys next year in 2012 to tell me, "Ian, I'm glad I came."
