"I wanted to go to a place where the needs were obvious and where our serving would touch the hearts of those we served as well as our own."

Travelling to Haiti marked my first visit to a 3rd world country and my first time using vacation time solely for the purpose of volunteering.  When I first heard about this opportunity, I was quick to take an interest:  it has been on my heart to live and work in a developing country and, what’s more, I was searching for the heart of Jesus in my life.  As the trip drew closer, I had many concerns about my ability to survive the week.  Could I handle the high heat and humidity?  Would there be enough bottled water for me to drink?  Would I like the food?  Would I be able to sleep okay and not be overwhelmed by all the social interactions?  I prayed about these things, got advice from others about what to bring and how to pack and set off hoping for the best.


Upon arrival in Port-au-Prince, we were shuttled by miniature school bus to Canapé Vert, the property owned by the Port-au-Prince church.  We had our orientation and split up into two teams:  half went to an orphanage at Ganthier and half to the Village of HOPE in Croix-des-Bouquets.  I was on the latter team.

It was inspiring visiting the church site where the disciples had slept and lived in tents for a year and a half after the 2010 earthquake.  We worshipped with the church on Sunday morning and were impacted by their joy and enthusiasm for worshipping God, not to mention their commitment to one another.  It was encouraging to hear of over 100 baptisms in the Haitian churches since the earthquake.  The disciples there are truly a light shining in a dark place.

Throughout the week we also had the opportunity to meet and talk with the other volunteers : there were 51 singles altogether on the trip, mainly from the U.S., although there was one from London, England in addition to myself and TC from Canada. I was inspired by conversations of other churches and the chance to meet other HOPE representatives on the trip, such as Dr. Mark Ottenweller, Dave Rodrick, Chantal & Wilner Cornely, and Lin Beaty.  These are great men and women of faith and I took note of their genuine love for people, their calm and the gratitude colouring all the work they are involved in.

The week wasn’t without some challenges. We slept on small mattresses on the floor of some of the almost finished houses for the week and some of the Haitian sisters in the villages prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner for us each day. Every day, we were tested by the heat, by lack of sleep, by hard manual labour and being away from the comforts of home.  But, though physically and emotionally demanding, the experience was very rewarding.

My team was serving at the Village of HOPE at Croix-des-Bouquets.  HOPE bought this 2.3 acre property and, in partnership with Food for the Poor, is now overseeing the construction of 40 houses.  Amazingly, all 40 houses will be occupied by disciples who had lost their homes in the earthquake.  This won’t be enough for the entire church, but HOPE hopes to do another such project in the future so the rest of the disciples can also have their own homes to live in.  25 houses are already completed, with 15 more to go. This village will essentially become a church and they will have their own services on site.

Our task for the week was to help build a road coming into this village.  This was hard work as we were moving boulders, shoveling gravel by hand or with shovels and buckets, all in 30+ degree temperatures, strong sun, and high humidity.  The culmination of this work allowed dump trucks to come and go on our new road, bringing construction supplies to the builders Without our road it would have been difficult or impossible for these trucks to get in because of how muddy and dug up parts of the road were when we came.


The experience offered me the personal challenge of getting out of my comfort zone; it wasn’t always easy to be surrounded by people all day and every day: I am used to having lots of space and lots of time to myself.  But I deliberately took some down time each day to rest and write out long prayers to God so that I could work through my emotions, anxieties and insecurities. With His help, I was able to find energy again to give and serve and have some great conversations with the other singles there.

The experience of my week in Haiti cemented the truth of Proverbs 11:25:  “A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.”  When we left, though exhausted, we were at the same time energized, purified, spiritually rejuvenated and refreshed.

Many of us became attached to the place and the people and leaving all this was sad. Many of us hope to go back again in a year or two to see the progress and to see the disciples again. I am so glad I could go and will definitely look for more opportunities to travel and do similar things or new things as I continue to find ways to give my life to God more completely.
