Two funny sisters in Christ who are always ready for opportunities to laugh, Lara Tai and
Laura Marijan, conducted a workshop in March titled "Improv is Fun" at a YWCA shelter in
Toronto.

They taught the women improv games similar to those seen on hit show, "Whose Line is It
Anyways," including the popular Yes And, Red Ball, Green Ball and "Make a story one word
at a time, which they thoroughly enjoyed.

Lara Tai commented on her experience; "It is quite a breakthrough for these woman as they
have come from surviving deep pain, mentally and physically. They all came from challenging
family or marital situations in Canada and elsewhere, some are new immigrants. We were so
happy they got a chance to be themselves in a safe environment to play again as they once did
as a child."

The rules of improv help to create an open, non- judgemental and fun environment where they
could enjoy and laugh together.

Laura Marijan felt that "It was such a joy to watch these women come out of their shells and
stretch themselves in new ways. One of our goals was to give them the freedom to simply play
and be silly, and the knowledge that it's okay to mess up, because often the victory itself is just
being able to say, 'Hey, I tried that!'. Everyone brought a unique part of themselves and we
definitely had a lot of laughs."

Improv is a great way to break down these barriers in a natural and playful way. The games
help to break barriers across colour, race, tribe, background, and bring people together to
become friends.

For Dan Tao, who helped to initiate the YWCA program, it was a rewarding experience: "The best reward of service is to feel the hope, joy and increased confidence shining through those precious women after a new skill learnt, a new challenge conquered and a new opportunity discovered. God created each one of us in such a unique and talented way so together we can experience the true wonder of inspire one another to live life to the full."
