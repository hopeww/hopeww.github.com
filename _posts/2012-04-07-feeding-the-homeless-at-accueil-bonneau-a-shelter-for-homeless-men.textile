The Accueil Bonneau is a well known shelter in Montreal where homeless men can go and eat two meals every day as well as find a bed to sleep.

The Quebec chapter of HOPE is helping by sending one volunteer every Wednesday and about 5 volunteers every last Saturday of each month. They help to set up tables, serving the food and cleaning up after each
meal.

Disciples in the Montreal church are so encouraged by this opportunity to serve, they even have more volunteers than the Accueil Bonneau shelter needs. They are actively looking for another organisation to serve.

Disciples from Montreal I excited to take every opportunity that HOPE and their Church gives them to serve the homeless outside their comfort zone. The Accueil Bonneau has been a good place to start for the volunteers They are dedicated to giving and serving the poor and help to ease their discomfort in any way that they can.
