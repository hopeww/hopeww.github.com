h2. Intro to Textile

All posts on this website uses the "Textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) markup language, it turns texts into html, so it's very easy to use.  Here is a Textile "sandbox.":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ for you to test the look & feel of your input.  This is also typically how people edit things like Wikipedia.

After a textile file is created, and we have the file uploaded to the server.  The server has some scripts that converts this Textile file into html which is what our audience sees in their web browser.

On our website, we only have the images hosted locally.  PDFs, Word docs, and forms (such as questionaires) are hosted on "Google Docs":http://docs.google.com.  Videos hosted on "Vimeo":http://vimeo.com/

This is how to add an image that floats to the right hand side.  You'll see that the image will float right, while the text wrap around it.  It looks nicer than the above version

Sometimes, you like to collect information from the users.  For example, take a look at our "volunteer registration form":/pages/outreach/volunteer.html.  Here are the steps that need to happen.

Currently, we use Google Docs, maybe down the road, we'll use something more suitable and robust for handling data collection from users.

# create a new form in Google Docs, via your hopewwcanada.org login
# change the theme to plain grey
# create all the questions you need
# make sure the form is not too long (about 4 questions each); add a page break
# share the form on the internet
# link the form to your posting

h3. Linking Form to Posting


Once the form is comopleted, we need to link the document the the post that you're writing.  Please be sure to change the formkey to the one that you've just created. In the example below, the formkey is @dEl4aG1zZzhNaGR6dEhRS0hCN1ZsM3c6MQ@.  Change the width & height attributes as desired.
