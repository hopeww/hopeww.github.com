Copy one of the other postings and change the @title@, the @published_date@, the @category@, and of course the content of the Textile file, which is @the story that the posting describes@.  

For the @category@ section, put down @Volunteer_Toronto_Active@ if this posting is active in Toronto, for instance.  If it is not active, just put @Volunteer_Toronto@.  You can also just delete files for postings that have expired.
