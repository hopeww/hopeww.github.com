h2. Introduction to Newsletter

The purpose of the newsletter is to help the audience of our site stay in touch of what our organization is doing and to continue building momentum in their lives.  We have two methods of distributing newsletters: *print* and   *digital / web based*.    The typical strategy so far had been to publish a newsletter every quarter.

h2. Digital Web based Newsletters

The digitial newsletter is also a Textile posting file.  Here's an example of what it looks like once it's published.

The web based newsletter can be copied by MarCom team and sent to everyone via ConstantContact, after the posting had been created on Textile & changes pushed on git.
