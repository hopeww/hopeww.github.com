h2. Introduction to Newsletter

The purpose of the newsletter is to help the audience of our site stay in touch of what our organization is doing and to continue building momentum in their lives.  We have two methods of distributing newsletters: *print* and   *digital / web based*.    The typical strategy so far had been to publish a newsletter every quarter.

h2. Print Newsletter

These are created by a member in MarCom as a PDF file & gets printed and distributed in the congregation

h2. Digital Web based Newsletters

The digitial newsletter is also a Textile posting file.  Here's an example of what it looks like once it's published.

The web based newsletter can be copied by MarCom team and sent to everyone via ConstantContact, after the posting had been created on Textile & changes pushed on git.

h2. Creating a new the Web based newsletter

h3. Steps:

# make copy of the last latest newsletter to use as template for the current one
# change the last latest newsletter to no longer be the latest newsletter, and make the one you copied the latest
# fill out your latest newsletter
# send it via constant contact

<hr />

h4. Make a copy of the last newsletter

In the _post directory, look for the newsletter that is the latest. Be careful of the date.

Create a copy, rename it to the date that it's meant to be published, but do not change the rest of the name.

So the format remains @2011-12-31-latest_newsletter.textile@

<hr />

h4. Change the last latest newsletter to no longer be the latest one

When you open up the last latest n.l, you'll see 
@category: Latest_Newsletter@, change it to be just @category: Newsletter@

Now, open up the current latest newsletter change the fields to reflect the correct date.
@published_date : "Feb 01, 2012"@ and @date_string : "2012/02/01"@  please keep the format the same.

<hr />

h4. Fill out the Latest newsletter

Now that the copied newsletter had became the latest newsletter, we need to fill these fields in correctly.

@large_story_1_heading : "John Riddle visited Haiti"@
@large_story_2_heading : "Camera donated to St. Lucia"@
@large_story_3_heading : ""@
@large_story_1_txt : "One of our brothers John Riddle visited Haiti for 2 months.  He helped build the village of HOPE.  It was really hard work, but very rewarding"@
@large_story_2_txt : ""@
@large_story_3_txt : ""@
@small_story_1_heading : ""@
@small_story_2_heading : ""@
@small_story_3_heading : ""@
@small_story_1_txt : ""@
@small_story_2_txt : ""@
@small_story_3_txt : ""@

Fill out action the section regarding the links (lnk) and images (img).  Make sure that the link is a fully qualified path, ie.  paste it from http://something.something.com and that the image is of small size, because as you can see the size of the newsletter is not that big.

<hr />

h4. Send it

I won't cover how to do that here.  MarCom Team will do this, just notify them when newsletter is published on the web.
