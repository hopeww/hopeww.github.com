h2(icon-trophy). &#160; Purpose & goals

The purpose of our website is to disseminate information to the public about the wonderful work that we're doing. Some potential constraints that we have is that we are a relatively young and perhaps lesser-known organization, also, that everything is ran by the effor of volunteers.  But we hope that by our communication of what God has achieved through us, we invite more & more people to join in knowing & serving God.  

Here are some tangible goals of what we should see in our website:

* work on mobile devices and large screens
* be clean and easy to navigate
* have meaningful and thought provoking images & content
* focus on connecting people to serve, and secondly to know God for those who doesn't know God
* allow people to watch videos created by volunteers easily
* allow people to volunteer easily
* give people an easy way to donate
* provide an easy way for users to see what's new
* allow the volunteers in support/operations team to go through different requests easily

h2(icon-star). &#160;Content is important!

The world is literally in information overload, and we're also trying to compete for a sliver of everyone's attention span, and so, we need to have great content. 

Here's a great article that emphasizes the importance of great content.

h2(icon-road). &#160; Background info

This section is just an FYI, you don't need in depth knowledge of any of these technologies. The parts relevant to you as web maintainer is at the very bottom.
  
h4. Intro to Textile

All posts on this website uses the "Textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) markup language, it turns texts into html, so it's very easy to use.  Here is a Textile "sandbox.":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ for you to test the look & feel of your input.  

As an example, this is also typically how people edit sites like "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup.  However, don't bother to study the "WikiMarkup language":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup, it is *not* the same thing as "Textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) which is what we use here.


h4. Where our Website is Hosted

Our website will be hosted by "GitHub":http://github.com  server.  Github is a open source code collaboration site & company.  It hosts the data like our Textile files, images, and the code for the site.  It is free for public code repositories.  

After a textile file is created, and we have the file uploaded to the server.  The server applies some scripts that converts this Textile file into html which is what our audience sees in their web browser. Thus all of the webpages are static, rather than dynamically generated.   Platforms like Wordpress / Joomla / Wikipedia, etc dynamically generate their website depending on how users are interacting with it.

For us, the more dyamic elements are handled by javascript, which is client side, that is lives on users' browser.


h4. Intro to Git

"GitHub":http://github.com uses a source control software called "git":http://git-scm.com/.  Git is a software that allows teams of people to work on projects at the same time.  It tracks different people's changes to files over time.  

Don't worry, you don't have to know much about git. We'll revisit how to use git in a little bit.


h4. Hosting of External Files

On our website, we only have the images hosted locally by "GitHub":http://github.com.  PDFs, Word docs, and forms (such as questionaires) are more appropriately hosted on "Google Docs":http://docs.google.com.  And videos hosted on "Vimeo":http://vimeo.com/


h4. Web & Framework

This website is built with Jekyll which is the software that generates the static pages once it's uploaded to Github.

The UI (user interface) framework is one called Bootstrap created by Twitter.  It provides a lot of great functionality such as tabs, popups, menus, cool looking buttons, etc. 

See "Jekyll-bootstrap":http://jekyllbootstrap.com/ for more info.
