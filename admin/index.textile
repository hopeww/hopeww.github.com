The purpose of our website is to disseminate information to the public about the wonderful work that we're doing. Some potential constraints that we have is that we are a relatively young and perhaps lesser-known organization, also, that everything is ran by the effor of volunteers.  But we hope that by our communication of what God has achieved through us, we invite more & more people to join in knowing & serving God.  

Here are some tangible goals of what we should see in our website:

- work on mobile devices and large screens
- be clean and easy to navigate
- focus on connecting people to serve, and secondly to know God for those who doesn't know God
- allow people to watch videos created by volunteers easily
- allow people to volunteer easily
- give people an easy way to donate
- provide an easy way for users to see what's new
- allow the volunteers in support/operations team to triage different requests easily
