##Purpose of Policy##
[www.hopewwcanada.org](www.hopewwcanada.org "HOPE worldwide of Canada") is committed to protecting your privacy and the information that you provide to us or that we collect. This policy discusses the type of information we collect, how we use it, whether we share it with others, what you can do to limit our use of it and how you can correct the information or have it deleted. Please read this policy carefully before using our web site. This policy applies to [www.hopewwcanada.org](www.hopewwcanada.org "HOPE worldwide of Canada") only and not to any other persons, organizations or entities linked to or included on the web site (referred to as "third parties"). This policy was developed using the laws and regulations of the United States as a guide. The laws and regulations of your country regarding privacy may be different, if you reside outside of the United States. For that reason we suggest that you check them. After doing so, you may decide not to provide personal information. However, if you do decide to continue to visit or use our web site, it is expressly understood that you agree to be bound by the provisions of this privacy policy.

##Information We Collect##

The submission of personal information is not required to use the general features of the web site. However, to access additional features like e-mail, chat rooms and message boards requires registration. Personal information, which you provide to us on a voluntary basis, is collected during the registration process. In the registration process we request your name, city, state/providence and country of residence, zip code, email address, gender and date of birth. We also require you to select a user name and a password. During the process of registration, you will be given the opportunity to submit additional information, as well as let us know if you're interested in receiving news about [www.hopewwcanada.org](www.hopewwcanada.org "HOPE worldwide of Canada") via our e-news letter. This additional information is not required for registration. If you do select this additional option, however, the information submitted will be collected along with the rest of your personal information.

###From Other Sources###
We also collect information about you, which we obtain whenever you visit our web site. We do this through using "cookies." Cookies are electronic identifiers, which we attach to your computer through your browser, that allow us to recognize you once you log on the web site. As a result of this improved recognition, we can simplify your experience and make your use of the web site much more convenient. For example, cookies help us provide you with customized information, which you select, without having to request it every time. Cookies also allow you to have a one time log in per session for areas that require registration (i.e., you won't have to continually enter your user name and password). Cookies also help us determine what our visitors are interested in. The cookie does not collect personal information, nor does it combine the information obtained with personal information. Also, once you sign off our web site the cookie disengages. It does not track where you go on the Internet unless you are on our web site. Some of the third parties linked to or included on our web site may use cookies. We have no control over their usage.

We may also collect certain technical information, which does not allow us to identify you personally, but pertains to your use of the Internet. For example, we can determine what type of browser you are using to access the site and thus give you optimized pages. This information is primarily for site management purposes and may be used to diagnose problems, follow user movement over the web site, determine and analyze user trends, collect aggregate data, identifying referring web site addresses, etc.

###How We Use the Information###
We will use the information that you submit or we collect, in aggregate form, to improve the site and your overall user experience. "Aggregate" in this context means in bulk, exclusive of specific personal information like name, city, state/province, country, zip code, e-mail address, etc.. Also, if we offer extra services, which are optional during registration, and we ask you for additional information, which you provide, then we will use your name and e-mail address to provide the services. For example, by "I want to receive additional information about [www.hopewwcanada.org](www.hopewwcanada.org "HOPE worldwide of Canada") via email" option, we use your name and e-mail address to forward the requested information to you.

###What Information Do We Share or Disclose ###
We will not sell, trade, rent or lease your personal information to other companies, except as otherwise provided herein. We may, however, share aggregate information with the third parties linked to or included on our web site.

We will share or disclose your personal information with others if (1) you consent to such disclosure; (2) you request something from us which requires us to provide the information in order to comply with your request; (3) a person, organization or entity that does work on our behalf needs the information in order to do the work, but only if the information is not used for other purposes and it is kept confidential and not retained after the work has been completed; (4) in compliance with any legal or administrative process, including subpoenas and court orders; (5) to enforce or apply this policy or any other agreement; or (6) to protect the rights or property of [www.hopewwcanada.org](www.hopewwcanada.org "HOPE worldwide of Canada") and/or the personal safety of its employees, users or others.

###Information From a Third Party###
We may notify you, from time to time, of information from a third party which we believe would be of interest to you. However, no personal information will be provided to the third party by HOPE _worldwide_. You may elect whether or not to contact the third party yourself in your sole discretion.

If you register or sign up for specific services, products or information from third parties linked to or included on our web site, and the third party collects personal information, you understand and agree that you will be subject to the third party's privacy policies, not ours, with respect to those transactions or activities.

Limiting Our Use to the Information and Editing, Correcting or Deleting It.
You can chose not to provide some or all of the personal information initially requested from you. However, by doing so you will not be granted access to e-mail, chat rooms, message boards, e-news letters or other services for which personal information is needed in order to obtain the service.

Another means of limiting our use to information is by rejecting cookies. This applies to our cookies and ones which third parties use on our web site.

You may also edit, correct or delete the personal information you have provided. In order to do so you must log on the web site using your user name and password.

Again, by deleting your personal information you will be denied access to and use of those services for which personal information is necessary in order to continue to use the service.
