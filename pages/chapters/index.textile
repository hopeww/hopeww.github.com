      <h5>History</h5>
        HOPE <i>worldwide</i> was founded in response to the Scriptures, which call us to have the heart of Jesus by serving the poor and needy around the world.
        <br />
      We began in 1991 with three small local programs. Today, HOPE <i>worldwide</i> operates on every inhabited continent, serving more than one million people annually.

    <h5>Partners</h5>
    We are proud of our history of collaboration.  Our valued relationship with the International Churches of Christ dates from our founding. Our global network has grown to include countless individuals and organizations who are valued partners in the fight against poverty.

    <h5>Local Chapters Governance</h5>
    Stated in the U.S., there are currently 110 Chapters.  Formerly chapters were named 'branches' or 'subsidiaries'.  Our goal is to have 141 U.S. chapters by the end of 2012.
         We started with 4 chapters in Canada. Our goal is to have 11 by the end of 2012.  <br />
        Each chapter will be governed by our Canadian Board of Directors and supported by a Local Board of Advisors.
  </li>

  <li class="project span3">

    <h5>Centrally Managed</h5>
    The <b>HOPE</b> <i>worldwide</i> of Canada Board will manage local chapters and coordinate days of service, national partnerships, nationwide fundraising directives, and grants management.
  </li>
  <li class="project span3">
    <img src="{{ ASSET_PATH }}/twitter/images/chapters/about/board.jpg"  />
    <h5>Locally Operated</h5>
    Each chapter is operated by a locally appointed leader and a board of advisors.
        <br />Within the local chapter, these servant leaders, are chosen because they are deemed adequately equipped and having a passion for serving the poor through the programs of HOPE <i>worldwide</i> of Canada.
        <br />The board of advisors meets quarterly to direct the chapter leader on how best to implement HOPE <i>worldwide</i> in the church and in the community. 
        <br />Most importantly, they also serve as the voice of the volunteers.

    <h5>Benefits to your church</h5>
        Service is an integral part of a follower of Christ.  It builds strong faith, increases gratefulness and obedience to the Word of God.
        <br />Volunteering with other faith groups serves to confirm one's faith rather than confuses it
        <br />It is an excellent public relations tool and outreach to the community.  
        <br />The bottom line is that we get a more giving, grateful, and God glorifying church.
