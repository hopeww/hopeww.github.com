    <p><h5>Local Chapters Governance</h5>
    Stated in the U.S., there are currently 110 Chapters.  Formerly chapters were named 'branches' or 'subsidiaries'.  Our goal is to have 141 U.S. chapters by the end of 2012.
        <p> We started with 4 chapters in Canada. Our goal is to have 11 by the end of 2012.  </p>
        <p> Each chapter will be governed by our Canadian Board of Directors and supported by a Local Board of Advisors.</p>
    </p>

    <p><h5>Locally Operated</h5>
    Each chapter is operated by a locally appointed leader and a board of advisors.
        <p>Within the local chapter, these servant leaders, are chosen because they are deemed adequately equipped and having a passion for serving the poor through the programs of HOPE <i>worldwide</i> of Canada.</p>  
        <p>The board of advisors meets quarterly to direct the chapter leader on how best to implement HOPE <i>worldwide</i> in the church and in the community. </p> 
        <p>Most importantly, they also serve as the voice of the volunteers.</p>

    <p><h5>Benefits to your church</h5>
        Service is an integral part of a follower of Christ.  It builds strong faith, increases gratefulness and obedience to the Word of God.
        <p>Volunteering with other faith groups serves to confirm one's faith rather than confuses it</p>
        <p>It is an excellent public relations tool and outreach to the community.  </p>
        <p>The bottom line is that we get a more giving, grateful, and God glorifying church.</p>
