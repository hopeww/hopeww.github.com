h2. What HOPE worldwide of Canada means to me?

To me HOPE worldwide is a hand filled with hope and love for all the needy of our hurting world. HOPE worldwide is thousands of volunteers with a huge caring heart ready to do anything and go anywhere to offer those facing challenges the right to live healthy and in decent conditions. Finally, to me HOPE worldwide gives me a great opportunity to use my talent and expertise to change lives.
