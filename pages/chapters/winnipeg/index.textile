h2. What HOPE worldwide of Canada means to me?

Whether involved in a large community project, making a donation for disaster relief or a few hours pitching in at a local shelter, HOPE worldwide of Canada provides me with the opportunity to be a champion for the needy, and to make a difference once small act of service at a time. HOPE unites me with other volunteers so that as a collective we can make a contribution to the eradication of poverty and injustice in our world.

h6. December 2011: Annual Christmas Dinner for Inner City Families

Since 1999, the Winnipeg chapter has partnered with Pregnancy and Family Support Services Inc., to host an annual Christmas dinner for underprivileged children and their parents from Winnipeg's downtown district. The 2011 banquet was a huge success as we served a delicious turkey dinner with all the trimmings to 54 families with a total of 141 people in attendance. The children made christmas crafts designed by HOPE volunteers while waiting for dinner and spent time singing and visiting with Santa after the meal. HOPE provided gifts to 133 children and their parents and surprised one lucky family with a door prize at the end of the evening. Photos
