h2. What HOPE worldwide of Canada means to me?

Whether involved in a large community project, making a donation for disaster relief or a few hours pitching in at a local shelter, HOPE worldwide of Canada provides me with the opportunity to be a champion for the needy, and to make a difference once small act of service at a time. HOPE unites me with other volunteers so that as a collective we can make a contribution to the eradication of poverty and injustice in our world.
