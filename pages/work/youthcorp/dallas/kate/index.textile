h2. Interview with Kate!

h6. Tell us about yourself (schooling, hobbies, future aspirations)

I am going into my first year of post-secondary education at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Canada. I am in a double degree program of business and financial math. Throughout high school, I took part in extra curricular activities such as girls varsity volleyball, the Prefect program (student leadership), the Social Justice club, and the Interact club, which focuses on improving and identifying needs in our own communities and around the world. I am in love with God and his Kingdom, and in the future I am working towards doing an internship in the campus or teen ministry over the next couple summers ahead.

h6. Why did you decide to take part in HOPE Youth Corps?

Throughout the past couple years, my family had undergone many financial troubles. It was through these challenges that I was able to see the power of God’s love and the church and the way that there was never a day when we we were neither unsheltered nor hungry. I learned that there were more important things in life than materialistic things, and that one of my duties as a disciple is to portray a glimpse of God’s love in the way that I live my life. It was so obvious that God had been and is continually taking care of me and my family and I wanted to find a way to show him my gratitude in a different way rather than giving back to Him through a contribution envelope. Therefore, through a lot of prayer I decided that I wanted to take part in Hope Youth Corps that may give me the opportunity to really give my heart to a child who may be undergoing severe troubles in his or her family and also to just be able to portray God’s amazing and fulfilling love.

h6. What were some of the highlights of your HYC Experience in Texas?

Thinking back to my two weeks in Texas, it is difficult to think of specific highlights that I was able to experience since there was never a dull moment when we were with the kids at the recreation center, when we were back at the church’s camp where we were staying, our weekend excursion to a rodeo or Medieval Times, or even the numerous bus rides coming from the city into the country.

One highlight of my HYC experience was when we took the kids from the Larry Johnson Recreation Center to Six Flags Water Park in Dallas. Taking a group of twenty-seven children and thirty teenagers to a water park with hundreds of people was a challenge, it was still fun and enjoyable. Throughout the first couple days, it was difficult for me to connect with my mentee, but the trip to Six Flags was memorable to me personally because it was the first time that my mentee put effort into building a friendship with me. But it came at the cost of carrying him on my shoulders for the entire day at the water park, but it was still worth it to see a big smile on his face.

h6. What’s a typical day like during your trip?

A typical day during Hope Youth Corps started out with an hour and a half drive to the city when one of the youth corps volunteers would lead the group in a devotional to prepare our hearts for the day of work. We would arrive at the Larry Johnson Recreation Center in the city of Dallas and be greeted with big smiles and hugs by our mentees. We would sing fun camp-like songs with the kids for a warm up to set a lively and uplifting spirit for the day. It was already by the second or third day when the kids would be volunteering to come to the front and help us lead songs. The rest of the day consisted of playing team building activities with the kids, when the mentors would be paired up with their mentee. At one point of the day, usually after lunch, we would have “Face book” time with your assigned mentee. This is when we would get to know about them and their families.

h6. What did you enjoy most about your experience in Texas?

Hope Youth Corps Dallas was overall an amazing, life changing experience. The factor that was the foundation of making it an unforgettable experience was the way our team of volunteers and leaders were able to bond so quickly and we formed a strong and supportive family. Every night, there would be a devotional lead by our site leader which focused on becoming the “Next Generation Leaders.” After our devotionals, we would have d-groups, separated by genders. It was during these times when we were able to share our lives with one another and grow deeper in our relationships.

h6. What did this experience in HYC (Texas) teach you?

There were many things that I learned at Hope Youth Corps which really helped me to grow spiritually and to also get me prepared for the next couple years of being in university, I feel like HYC has helped to mould my heart and train me for the next stage in my life.

One thing was just seeing how fast and how much God is able to work in such a small period of time with a small group of people was just amazing. But on the same lines of seeing how much God was working through us, we were able to see how fast Satan could attack us. Hope Youth Corps was a really eye-opening experience because God truly showed us how important it was to be a family and to just love each other. Even though it was hard at times to call each other out, it was totally necessary, because if we didn’t, it would really affect the way we would serve the kids and just generally our attitudes for the rest of the day. Satan’s key tactic was to divide us and it really needed to be on our hearts that we would do anything to not let that happen. That is one thing I wanted to take back with me was to just transform the relationships I had back home with my ministry; to be calling each other out because we love each other, but also be encouraging to one another to build each other up.

Another thing that I experienced during HYC was just how humbling it was to see how powerful prayer truly is. It was totally by God’s power that we were able to survive the two weeks with the kids since it was very tiring. It says in Isaiah 40:30, “Even youths grow tired and weary, but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.” Our site leaders would always encourage us to to pull aside a brother or a sister and just pray with them for strength whenever we were feeling tired during the day with the kids. God really tested us to see if our hearts were constantly in the right place to be serving these kids because we were there to show them what Jesus’ love is like. At the end of the day, my experience in HYC really taught me that it is crucial to get my strength from God and not lean on my own strength or else I won’t reach the full potential that God has set out for me.



h6. Any advice to offer those interested in HYC?

If you’re able and willing to go, definitely take part of HYC! But for those who don’t think it will be a possibility since it is too expensive, there are so many ways and opportunities to fundraise, it just has to be on your heart that you really want to serve.

It is an experience that will help mould your character in ways that you didn’t expect, you will build deep friendships with people who will love and support you for the rest of your life, and you will see your faith being stretched in incredible and amazing ways. It may have become a cliche that HYC is a life changing experience, but if you go into it with no expectations, you will see God blow your mind away, and that’s faith building on it it’s own.

h6. Has this experience helped you view to service to the poor and needy differently from before?

Most of the time, I feel that we get trapped into thinking that in order to make an impact in the world, we need to do something huge and extravagant with a really huge group of people. Yes, it is true, there are many big needs in our communities and around the world that need big groups of people to help and accomplish big projects. But at the same time, there are little needs that are just as important. Through HYC, it was incredible to see the impact we had on these little kids by just being their friend. Many of them are growing up in harsh environments of abuse, single parent households, or not even knowing either of their parents, but the eagerness that each of these kids had to just be loved by anyone was so evident. I am so grateful to God that he was able to open my eyes to this need in the world that everyone, especially children, need to have the opportunity to see and feel God’s love.

h6. Final thoughts

Being a part of Hope Youth Corps Dallas has changed my life in numerous ways additional to what has already been shared. When I come across difficult and challenging times throughout the year, HYC is one of those times in my life that I will look back to and be reminded of the great and faith building times I experienced in those short two weeks. It produced not only a new testimony that I am able to share with others, but also a hope that my relationship with God is able to grow in exponential ways if I have the attitude in Isaiah 6:8 of, “Here am I, send me.”
