My name is Gillian and this past summer I had the opportunity to be a part of HOPE Youth Corps in Philadelphia. I am 17 years old and I have been a disciple for two years now and this experience was most definitely a significant milestone in my walk with God.

I decided to join Youth Corps because of the amazing stories that I had heard from friends who had been a part of it in previous years. It had always been a common theme that the lessons learned at HOPE Youth Corps greatly shaped who they became as followers of Jesus Christ. My whole life I feel like I’ve always been the one who was given to and I felt like it was time for me to give back.

On a typical day at Youth Corps, we would start our day off with our personal time with God -surrounded by His beautiful creation -and then jumpstart into the day bright and early. Throughout the day we had practical lessons involving the theme “Radical” and we spent many hours with our d-groups; getting open about our lives and calling each other higher. We were able to help serve by taking an afternoon to stain the deck at Camp HOPE and enjoyed each other’s company as we did this task. We had many day trips all together such as driving into worship with the Philadelphia Church of Christ, tubing down the Delaware River, and leading bible talks on various university campuses in the city. Once we started Camp Miracles, where we mentored inner-city kids at Camp HOPE, our days were filled with activities that we would do together with our mentees. These would create opportunities to learn about team-building and build trust. We used Camp Miracles as a chance to show these kids who have been so broken by the trials of this life, Christ’s love and we built relationships with them that we truly intend to keep.

After working with these kids who have been dealing with so many challenges in their past, I learned so much through them about my own relationship with God. The child I mentored was dealing with a lot of feelings of abandonment and I had to learn how to see past my own feelings of hurt when she would put up walls and to love her despite her pushing me away. I saw a parallel in my friendship with my mentee and my own relationship with God because I can be the one who puts up walls against God to protect myself from getting hurt or being abandoned and there’s never a question of whether God is going to love me anyway. As I learned that it was necessary to have a love that was unconditional for my mentee, I learned how unfaltering God’s love is for me no matter how many times I push him away.

I came into this Youth Corps wondering how I could make a difference in these kids’ lives not realizing that it was them who would change me forever. If you have the opportunity to participate in HOPE Youth Corps I recommend this to anyone as a chance to serve and to grow in your relationship with God.
